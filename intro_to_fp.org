* What is FP?

* What is a value

 - immutable vs mutable
 - referencial transparency

* What is a function

 - function vs method
 - pure function

#+END_SRC


* What is polymorphism?

 - how to achieve polymorphism in FP vs OOP?
 - subtyping
 - ad hoc polymorphism (method overloading)
 - parametric polymorphism

* Macros vs Monads?
